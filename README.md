# zahlenstrahl


â€¦ is a tiny simplistic client-side app that creates very simple number lines. An
instance is hosted [here](https://dpaetzel.de/zahlenstrahl).


The overall stage of the project is very beta as it was mainly a means for me to
learn a little bit of [PureScript](https://www.purescript.org/) and
[halogen](https://github.com/purescript-halogen/purescript-halogen). But hey,
maybe it's useful for people even in its current state.
